Replay - cleanCode
====================
Clean code files (ESLint + Sublime configuration) for our current project (Replay).

**Please download and read the _Installation.odt_ file.**

For more information about style guides please refer to:
* [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml#Deferred_initialization)
* [Felix's Node.js Style Guide](http://nodeguide.com/style.html)

_(Also maybe: [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](http://airbnb.io/javascript/))_

In our current project (Replay) we are using conventions based on both Google's style guide, and Felix's recommendations.
But we add some modification to ease on us the harsh rules of Google... :wink:
